# Python-Codes

Hi Everyone,

I am relatively new to programming and my first language on this journey was Python. 

I will look to add some web development projects in the near future.

I am a banker by profession with over 16 years experience, but I always had a look of IT and computer science.

I am seeking an entry into the software development industry and want to showcase some of the algorithms and functions that I have completed.

I even helped complete some important functions of a simple word game too!

Enjoy!
